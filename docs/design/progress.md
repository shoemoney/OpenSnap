# OpenSnap implementation progress

**Baseline:** `bad6617`, when implementation began (the rename and migration were already merged in `f7ff86b` and `d2dc3c9`).
**Main now:** `f3ba77f`, after six merges.
**Status of 36 todos:** 20 done, 2 verified, 1 not-a-bug, 1 in-progress (OSN-041), 12 pending.

Per-todo state is in `backlog.json` (`status`, `mainState`, `implementation`). The roadmap has the milestone table (section 2b). Findings statuses in the roadmap (section 4) are still as at `dc1eb26`.

## Issue to implementation to test to render

Each row is a todo that is done, verified, or not-a-bug. Commits in brackets are the branch commits that carry the work, attributed by commit subject. "Tested" gives only the counts the sources record. "Rendered" is the evidence folder under `docs/design/evidence/impl-2026-10-09/`; `n/a` means no rendered evidence is recorded for that todo.

Suite counts are the ones the sources record. No other counts are claimed.

## Open items and gaps

- **Unsafe tool still on main:** `tools/test-native-startup.py` launches the real bundle id in place. The fix is in progress on `impl/m4-type`. Do not run it until that is merged.
- **Round-1 incident (OSN-001):** a can-fail proof deleted the owner's real `com.shoemoney.opensnap` defaults plist. Cause: a cleanup trap was installed before an id refusal. Fixed in `db973a6`. The SkitchRedux store and `com.shoemoney.skitch-redux.plist` hashed unchanged. The migration marker is a file in the absent OpenSnap folder, so the parked migration is unaffected.
- **Deferred to OSN-042:** the phantom capsule under Snap (the hidden Cancel glass surface); the full-screen salmon tint and accent loss (backdrop vibrancy); the legacy-scroller white corner.
- **Size popover** can overhang the window edge. It stays on screen and is accepted as standard NSPopover behaviour.
- **Canvas centring** was a pre-existing bug, also present at `bad6617`. It is fixed for document changes in the rail-removal branch (`c53155c`).
- **Q3** is open until the OSN-042 spike. The glass budget differs between the spec (5 surfaces, section 0) and T4 (8 surfaces).
- **Settings** window is still titled "Preferences" (OSN-051).
- **Not run:** live screen capture; real popover translucency; VoiceOver speech (OSN-062 manual pass); injected Reduce Transparency and Increase Contrast captures (OSN-061); FA icon mode.
- **OS-owned text (D-TEXT):** menu-bar strip titles, window title-bar text, system tooltips inside system panels, NSAlert text size, Save, Open and Print panels, Fonts and Colors panels.
- **OSN-023:** manual 1x and 2x menu-bar check not done.
- **OSN-041 in progress:** chrome, App, Resize, Photos, TextStyle, Hotkeys, Export and the 20 pt tooltips remain. The worker on `impl/m4-type` is not merged.
- **OSN-070:** the gates beyond the four on main (`check-no-original.py`, `check-clean-clone.sh`, `check-brand.py`, `check-tokens.py`) are not recorded as landed.
- **OSN-072:** migration on a copy of the owner's real store is not authorized in this run. Synthetic temp stores only.
- **Not done:** no push and no release. The first real launch and migration on the owner's machine is parked by the owner.
